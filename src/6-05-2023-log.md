# changes
---
- Moved `noteList` to left side
- `editor` and `outputField` are displayed side-by-side (instead of top-and-bottom)
- Added code language flair to right corner of code blocks

# to-do
---
- Change side-by-side live preview to "Source mode" and "Read mode"
    - Source mode displays RAW markdown contents and ALLOWS editing
    - Read mode displays RENDERED Markdown contents and DISABLES editing
        - `Ctrl + E` or `Cmd + E` to toggle modes
    - Must ensure that current cursor position AND current scroll position is preserved when toggling modes

# issues
---
- Selection cursor autoamtically goes to the end of the Markdown file when you type characters 300ms apart
    - 300ms is the length of the debounce timer for `saveMarkdownToFile()`
