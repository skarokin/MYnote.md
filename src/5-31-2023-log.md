# today's goals
---
- Fix highlighting of Notes tab to only highlight text content 
    - **APPROACH:** Make the text content a span instead, so Notes tab is a list of spans of text, instead of a list of text
- Add indentation guides
    - **APPROACH:** Add an `indented` class to any indented text/to list items by utilizing `li::before` and `p::before` properties
- Fix auto-bracket closing by skipping to next character if the closing bracket is typed by instinct after typing the opening bracket
- Fix this error `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '0') at HTMLTextAreaElement.<anonymous> (render.js:169:74)`
    - It doesn't break anything just really annoying to see on the console lol
- Add more auto-closing, such as for `<`, `$`, and `` ` ``
- Implement a UI for note creation and deletion 
- Move Notes tab to the left side
