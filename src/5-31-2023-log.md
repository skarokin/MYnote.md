# changes
---
- Changed code font from `Consolas` to `Fira Code`
    - Inline code remains as is, i.e. `Ubuntu Mono`
    - Inline code now has padding and background color
    - Changed padding for code blocks from `7px` to `5px`
- Modified the event listener for enter to ensure that Markdown is rendered and saved to file after enter key press
- Fixed highlighting of Notes tab to only highlight text content by making a list of spans and changed the event listener on `fileList` to look for `if (target.tagName === 'SPAN')` instead of looking for `tagName === 'LI'`
- Added more auto-closing for `<`, `$`, and `` ` ``
    - Changed the event listener for auto-closing to utilize `closingCharactersMap` instead of hard-coding all the separate characters

# today's goals
---
- Add indentation guides
    - **APPROACH:** Add an `indented` class to any indented text/to list items by utilizing `li::before` and `p::before` properties
- Fix auto-bracket closing by skipping to next character if the closing bracket is typed by instinct after typing the opening bracket
- Fix this error `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '0') at HTMLTextAreaElement.<anonymous> (render.js:169:74)`
    - It doesn't break anything just really annoying to see on the console lol
- Implement a UI for note creation and deletion 
- Move Notes tab to the left side 
- Fix the issue that the selection sometimes automatically goes to the last character (hard to recreate... not sure exactly what causes this)

# to-be-implemented
---
- Make rendering dynamic
- Make the app zoomable
- UI for note outline (makes note navigable)
- Read-only mode
- UI for folder creation, deletion, and renaming
- Handle image pasting
    - **APPROACH:** Attach a `paste` event listener to `editor` and check if the pasted data is of type `image`. Then, make a `handleImageFile()` function to upload the image to the system, and obtain the embed HTML. Finally, make an `insertImageAtCursor()` function to preserve cursor position and focus
- View multiple notes at once
- Change to rich text Markdown editor
- Drag and drop notes into folders
    - **APPROACH:** When a note is created, create `li` element with `draggable="true"` property in the currently selected folder. Then, define drop-zones for folders by making each folder a `div` element, giving it a `class="folder"`, and giving it the `droppable="true"` property.
        - Add event listeners for `dragover` and `drop` events to each folder. When a note is dragged over a folder, the `dragover` event is triggered, and use `event.preventDefault()` to enable dropping. Finally, when a note is dropped into a folder, the `drop` event is triggered and it retrieves the ID of the dragged note by using `event.dataTransfer.getData()`, finds the corresponding note element, and appends it to the folder

I really like making inline LaTeX... $\sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k(k + 1)} = \frac{n}{n + 1}$

I really like making nice looking code blocks using `Atom One Dark` theme...
```js
function handleImageFile(file) {
    // Upload file to the system and get the URL or embed HTML
    // Insert URL/embed HTML into `editor` 
    const imageURL = "https://example.com/images/image.jpg";
    const embedHTML = `<img src="${imageURL}" alt ="Pasted image"/>`;
    insertTextAtCursor(editor, embedHTML);
