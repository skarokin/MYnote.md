# changes
---
- Changed color of the selected note background to match context menu selected item background
- Added border to context menu
- Added icons for deleting and renaming upon right clicking a Note
- Added file delete functionality
    - Must add confirmation functionality later
    - Fixed a problem with the asynchronous nature of `fs.unlink()` in which ANY previously selected file was deleted upon calling `deleteFile()` by storing the target file path outside of the event listener and making the event listener for the context menu NOT nested in the `noteList`
- Fixed the error `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '0') at HTMLTextAreaElement.<anonymous> (render.js:169:74)`
- Combined all event listeners in `editor` for tab, keep-indent, indent removal, and auto-close characters into one event listener 
- Added file rename functionality
