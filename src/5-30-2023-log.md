# changes
---
- Removed `handleFileSelection()` as file selection is now handled via the fileList and event listeners

# issues
---
- Selection sometimes goes to the very end of the editor (hard to replicate, can't figure out why)
    - **SUSPECTED CAUSE:** Auto-indentation or auto-bracket closing or pasting
- When doing the following operations on `.md` files, I want this to happen:
    - **RENAME:** If selected file is renamed, it must STAY selected
        - Currently, if selected file is renamed, it removes selection and throws an error that the file is not found
    - **DELETE:** If selected file is deleted, must remove all data from the editor and remove selected class 
        - Currently, if selected file is deleted, it does nto remove data from editor, and throws an error that the file is not found

# to-be-implemented
---
- Change rendering system to dynamically render changes instead of re-rendering the entire document upon every input
- UI for note outline (display headers in order)
- UI for viewing, creating, deleting, and editing notes
    - I have a very rudimentary selectable list of `.md` files in `./src` so far
- UI for organizing notes in folders
- Implement a read-only mode 
- View multiple notes at once
- Handle image pasting
