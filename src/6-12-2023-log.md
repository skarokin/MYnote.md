# changes
---
- Changed margin of all headers to be `15px 0px` (for uniformity)
- Changed all styles of `editor` to match the styles of `outputField` (for uniformity)
- Added Source + Reading mode functionality
	- Toggle modes using `Ctrl/Cmd + E` OR by clicking the button on the top right of the document

# issues
---
- When switching from Reading mode to Source mode, document scrolls to the cursor position that was saved in the prior iteration of Source mode, instead of staying in the current scroll position
- Styling of code blocks in Source mode is not normalized with Reading mode
    - I MIGHT have to switch to HyperMD to fix this.... but I'm trying to figure out a non-HyperMD solution

# fixes
---
- Fixed issue where the code flair indents the first line of code by adjusting positioning of `pre` to be relative, then adjusting positioning of `pre .code-flair` to be absolute, and adjusting right positioning of `pre .code-flair` to be `4%`
- Fixed issue of undo history not being cleared when loading a new file
- Fixed issue of code flair forcing first line of code blocks to be indented
- Fixed issue of first line of indentation being double-indented (because of the addition of `.cm-span`)
    - Added the below to `editor` options to achieve desired behavior

```js
indentUnit: 4, // Set the desired number of spaces for indentation
indentWithTabs: false, // Use soft tabs for indentation
extraKeys: {
    // Use spaces for indentation instead of .cm-tab
    Tab: function(cm) {
        if (cm.somethingSelected()) {
            // Indent selected lines
            cm.indentSelection("add"); 
        } else {
            cm.replaceSelection(cm.getOptasdfasdfion("indentWithTabs")
            ? "\t" 
            : Array(cm.getOption("indentUnit") 
            + 1).join(" "), "end"); 
        }
    }
}
```
