# changes
---
- Changed "Live preview" to "Source mode + Read-only mode"
    - Philosophy changed from WYSIWYG to WYSIWYM, then you can see rendered markdown upon `Ctrl + E || Cmd + E`
    
- This significantly improves user experience for those who like WYSIYWM... but not much so for those who like WYSIWYG... too bad... i guess

```js
const add = (x, y) => {
    return x+y
}
```
