# changes
---
- Removed extraneous calls of `renderMarkdown()`
    - When `saveMarkdownToFile()` is called, it changes contents of file. `fileWatcher` is active at this time, which calls `handleFileChange()`, which calls `renderMarkdown()`. Further, upon any input in the `editor`, there is a call to `saveMarkdownToFile()`. Thus, anytime `saveMarkdownToFile()` is called or `editor` event listener for `input` is triggered, there is no need to call `renderMarkdown()` before it.
    - Essentially, Markdown rendering goes like this: Edit contents in `editor` => Save contents of `editor` to the `.md` file => `fileWatcher` catches the changes to the `.md` file and calls `handleFileChange()` => `handleFileChange()` reads contents of the `.md` file and calls `renderMarkdown()` which renders to `outputFiled`  
- When user renames, or cancels renaming a file (whether it is currently selected or not), automatically focuses on editor again
- Fixed error of selection sometimes automatically going to the end of `editor` by saving the `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` at each input, then after `renderMarkdown()` is called, restore that selection
- Added "New folder" button (not functional yet)
- Made new icons for:
    - Note: note, and new
    - Folder: closed, open, and new

# issues
---
- `renderMarkdown()` is called twice per input... can't figure out why
- Clicking outside of span when attempting to rename file does not cancel renaming
- Clicking "Rename" icon and "Delete" icon (instead of the text) does not execute function

# todays goals
---
- When clicking "Rename" or "Delete" in context menu, allow clicking of icon itself
    - Currently, Rename and Delete only work when the text is clicked, and clicking the icon doesnt work
- Display language in code blocks on the top right
- Upon creating new file, automatically prompt for renaming
- When clicking outside of span, cancel rename
- Get folder functionality working
- Notes context menu functionality:
    - \[Section 1\] 
        - Rename
        - Open in new tab
        - Copy note link (for backlinking)
    - \[Section 2\] 
        - Make a copy
        - Move file to...
        - Export to PDF
    - \[Section 3\] 
        - Delete 
- Folders context menu functionality:
    - \[Section 1\] 
        - Rename
        - New note
        - New folder
    - \[Section 2\] 
        - Move folder to...
        - Set as attachment folder (the path where pasted images go to)
    - \[Section 3\]
        - Delete
- Allow drag-and-dropping files/folders into folders
