- Fixed issue of selection automatically going to end of `editor` if typing characters 300ms apart (finally omg)
    - Instead of updating `editor` with file contents on 300ms debounce, we are now updating file with `editor` contents on 300ms debounce
    - Got rid of `fileWatcher` and `startFileWatching()` and `stopFileWatching()` 
    - This forces us to reload or reselect the page if a change is made directly to the `.md` file. However, this is MUCH better than dealing with selection cursor going to the end

# to-do
---
- Implement Source mode + Reading mode
    - Normalize all styles between Source and Read mode (for fluidity)
    - Save scroll position and cursor position when toggling modes (for fluidity)
    - Only render Markdown when in Reading mode
- Fix issue of selection automatically going to end of editor if typing characters 300ms apart
    - **APPROACH:** Instead of updating `editor` with file contents on 300ms debounce, update the file with `editor` contents on 300ms debounce. 
        - Initial file loading will be based on the contents of the `.md` file upon loading... having to refresh the page if directly editing the `.md` file is MUCH better than dealing with selection cursor automatically going to the end of the editor
- If typing an opening character then, directly after, typing the closing character, DO NOT type closing character, instead move selection to outside the opening + closing character
- Add auto-list continuation upon pressing `Enter`
    - Auto-list continuation must preserve indentation
    - If `Enter` is pressed on an empty list item, then delete the current list item, and delete all indentation
- If typing an opening character before an already existing character that is not in `closingCharactersMap`, do not insert the closing character
- Allow users to highlight blocks of text and do the following functions on the highlighted blocks:
    - Indent with `Tab`
    - Bold with `Ctrl + B`
    - Italicize with `Ctrl + I`
