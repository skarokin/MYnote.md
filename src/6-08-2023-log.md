- Changed editor to be `CodeMirror`
	- Kind of a copout, but I already implemented EVERYTHING by hand... the reason for this change is simply the fact that I can individually style things in the `CodeMirror` editor that I couldn't do in the editor that I created
# to-do
---
- Implement Source mode + Reading mode
    - Normalize all styles between Source and Read mode (for fluidity)
    - Save scroll position and cursor position when toggling modes (for fluidity)
    - Only render Markdown when in Reading mode
- Add auto-list continuation
	- Figure out how to utilize `continuelist.js`
